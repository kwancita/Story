Today I order Matcha green tea latte with 6 scoops of matcha powder but I got regular standard. This is happened so many time but I don't want to tell the barista to  redo it and waste the one that already made. I guess one of  the reason the cashier can't hear what customer order is  the music that so loud. I just want to get my order correct.
